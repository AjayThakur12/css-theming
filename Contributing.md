## Versioning

We use semantic versioning.

Use `npm version [...]` to update the version in both git and package.json files.

## Publishing

We use the "files" property in package.json to include things we want in the npm package.

Use `npm pack` to create a zipped package so that you can inspect the files the user will acquire.
